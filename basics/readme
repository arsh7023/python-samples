python -c "print('hello')"

In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _

print("""\

>>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)

-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.

Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
>>> word[:2] + word[2:]
'Python'
>>> word[:4] + word[4:]
'Python'


letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
letters[2:5] = ['c', 'd', 'e'] => since end always excluded.  from index 2 to index 4 (5 excluded)

len(letters)

print(a, end=',')
The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:
